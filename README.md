# Educational Pool Simulation

This is a web application modelling and simulating the physics involved in a game of pool. It allows the user to modify parameters such as the coefficient of 
restitution and uses those values to predict the path of each ball. 

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in July 2021 during a co-op term.
