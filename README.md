# **Educational Pool Simulation**  

This web application models and simulates the **physics of a game of pool**, allowing users to modify parameters such as the **coefficient of restitution** to observe how these values affect the motion and collisions of the balls.  

## **Project Overview**  
- Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in **July 2021** during a co-op term.  
- Developed to **assist in the teaching of Mec E 265** at the **University of Alberta**.  
- The simulation is used in [Professor Nobes' course material](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~dnobes/Teaching_Section/NOBES_SIM_Pool.html).  

## **Learning Outcomes**  
Building this project without a framework like React helped me strengthen my **fundamentals of web development**, particularly in **JavaScript, physics-based simulations, and DOM manipulation**. I also gained a deeper understanding of **collision mechanics and restitution principles**.
